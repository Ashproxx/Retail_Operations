# M14 documentary deliverables

Active branch: `docs/ml-methodology`. Base: `integration/dual-model-retailops` at `c27fef0a0c5cf7c84551a5940ef3ced8e9f00b93`, the published version preceding the user's approval to start M14 on 23 October 2026.

Owned scope: `docs/ml/`, this branch's README/deliverables, and branch-only knowledge-graph delta. No application, database, dependency, CI, shared guard or source-branch changes. No new dependencies or external data/model calls.

Delivered: methodology/report chapter and Mermaid pipeline, data card, feature availability contract, reproducible aggregate audit, and separate M14–M20 ledger. Local documentation checks are recorded in `docs/ml/VALIDATION.md`. M14's specific documentation is ready; full inherited acceptance is pending (see `docs/ml/MILESTONES.md`). No M15 implementation is authorized by this branch.

Graph delta: `docs/ml/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_DELTA.json`. Integration requires later human approval; main remains untouched. Existing source branches and demo checkpoint remain usable.

# Integration deliverables

Current Phase 3 deliverables: [development report](docs/phase3/VALIDATION.md) and [hard milestone ledger](docs/phase3/MILESTONES.md). Source SQL importers, separate retail/HR services, HR permissions, four-model selector and responsive website are implemented. Main merge requires explicit final authorization. Historical M13 below describes the earlier release only.

## Historical release candidate

M13 INCOMPLETE; weighted completion remains 95%.

- [x] Explicit approval recorded with pinned sources/base
- [x] Candidate created from approved foundation
- [x] Approved source commits integrated; source implementations preserved
- [x] Original metadata archived by branch
- [x] Authenticated API and explicit role/store checks before reads
- [x] All eight domain agents wired through LangGraph and registry
- [x] Multi-agent aggregation, conflict escalation and bounded execution
- [x] Conservative natural-language parameter bridge and scoped follow-up memory
- [x] Atomic CSV/XLSX ingestion with validation and fixture provenance
- [x] Persistent SQL records, owned feedback, durable audit chain

- [x] Source-preservation/ancestry scope guard
- [x] Candidate implementation pushed and fetched; file tree/ancestry verified
- [x] All fourteen pre-existing branch refs, including main, verified unchanged
- [x] Live Ollama smoke test with an installed model (SmolLM2 135M)
- [x] Pinned pretrained embeddings and labelled synthetic retrieval evaluation (MiniLM, 12 positive / 2 negative queries)
- [ ] Real retail dataset mapping and end-to-end validation
- [x] Previous remote CI and Docker image build verified (run 35878697558)
- [x] Expanded container runtime, real Ollama and pretrained retrieval checks verified (run 35909119561)
- [ ] M13 complete / eligible for final human review

Publication evidence and source/main ref checks are recorded in docs/integration/REPORT.md and the session report. No main merge is authorized.

## Interactive showcase extension

- [x] Responsive same-origin dashboard connected to authenticated inventory, analytics, forecast, chat, feedback and audit APIs.
- [x] Opt-in, localhost-only temporary synthetic database; normal operational startup remains empty.
- [x] Windows launch and presentation guide: [DASHBOARD.md](docs/integration/DASHBOARD.md).
- [x] Full local Python suite: 180 passed; source-preservation guard passed.
- [ ] Real dataset mapping and business validation (unchanged M13 requirement).
